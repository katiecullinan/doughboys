	<p id="intro_text">A doughnut or donut is a type of fried dough confectionery or dessert food. The 
	doughnut is popular in many countries and prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade 
	or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty outlets. They are usually 
	deep-fried from a flour dough, and typically either ring-shaped or without a hole and often filled.  </p>

	<h2 class="head">ORIGINS</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="origins_text class">In ancient Rome and Greece, cooks would fry strips of pastry dough and coat them with honey or fish sauce. In Medieval times, Arab cooks started frying up small portions of unsweetened yeast dough, drenching the plain fried blobs in sugary syrup to sweeten them. The fritters spread into northern Europe in the 1400′s and became popular throughout England, Germany and the Netherlands. In 15th century Germany, where sugar was hard to come by, they were often cooked savory with fillings like meat or mushroom.   </p>

	<h2 class="head2 clear">THE NEW WORLD</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="origins_text2 class" >The doughnut came to America with the Dutch who settled in Manhattan (then New Amsterdam). They called them <i>olykoeks</i> or oily cakes.  These early doughnuts were simply balls of cake fried in pork fat until golden brown. Because the center of the cake did not cook as fast as the outside, the cakes were sometimes stuffed with fruit, nuts, or other fillings that did not require cooking. </p>

<h2 class="head">THE HOLE</h2>
<hr>
	<p class="origins_text class">The hole invention is generally attributed to Captain Hanson Gregory, a Dutch sailor whose mother made him some doughnuts for a voyage. There are many variations on this story but one is that on June 22, 1847, Captain Gregory’s ship hit a sudden storm. He impaled the doughnut on one of the spokes on the steering wheel to keep his hands free. The spoke drove a hole through the raw center of the doughnut and he said he liked the doughnuts better that way, minus the raw center  </p>
	
	<h2 class="head2 clear">WWI</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="origins_text3 class"> Doughnuts became popular in the US after American soliders returned home from WWI. During the war female Salvation Army workers known as “Doughnut Girls” would fry and distribute doughnuts to the American soldiers fighting in France. They offered a taste of home to the soldiers, who became known as “Doughboys.” Doughnut Girls were replaced by “Doughnut Dollies” during World War II. </p>

    <h3>Glazed</h3>
    <p> A glazed doughnut commonly refers to a plain, yeasted doughnut in a sweet sugar glaze, 
    though many other types of doughnuts have glazes, as well.  
    Just about every American doughnut shop will make some version of these.</p>

    <h3>Cake</h3>
    <p> Doughnuts made from a cake-like batter, leavened not with yeast but baking powder or soda. The resulting texture 
    is denser than a yeasted doughnut, and often a bit crustier. Cider doughnuts and old-fashioneds, fall within the cake doughnut category.

    <h3>Old-Fashioned</h3>
    <p> Old-fashioned doughnuts are cake doughnuts that tend to have an irregular ring shape.
     They also usually have a bit more crunch on the outside, both by nature of the style and due to the increased surface area. 
     An "old-fashioned doughnut" generally suggests a plain sweet base, though chocolate old-fashioned doughnuts 
     are quite prevalent as well.

		<h2 class="recipe_head1">Yeast</h2>
		
	<div class="toggle1">	
		<ul>
		<li>1 tbsp plus 1 tsp active dry yeast</li>
		<li>1 cup whole milk, heated to 110°F </li>
		<li>2 to 2 1/2 cups (320 to 400 grams) bread flour </li>
		<li> 1 tsp pure vanilla extract </li>
		<li> 3 large egg yolks </li>
		<li> 2 tbsp (30 grams) superfine sugar </li>
		<li> 1/2 tsp table salt </li>
		<li> 4 tbsp unsalted butter, softened at room temperature and cut into cubes </li>
		<li> Vegetable oil for frying </li>
	</ul>

	<ol>
	<li>In a medium bowl, combine 1 tbsp of the yeast with 3/4 cup of the warm milk and stir to dissolve the yeast. 
	Add 3/4 cup of the flour and stir to create a smooth paste. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the flour 
	mixture rest in a warm place for 30 minutes. </li>
 <br />
	<li>Next, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the 
	remaining 1 teaspoon yeast with the remaining 1/4 cup milk. 
	Add the flour mixture along with the vanilla and egg yolks and mix on low until the ingredients are 
	incorporated and the dough is smooth. Turn off the mixer and add 1 cup of flour, along with 
	the sugar and salt. Mix on medium until the dough starts to come together. Add the butter 
	and mix on medium until it's incorporated. </li>
 <br />
	<li>Remove the paddle attachment from the mixer, and switch to the dough hook. Start adding the remaining flour, 
	1/4 cup at a time (turning the mixer off for each addition) and knead the dough on medium until it completely 
	pulls away from the side of the bowl and is smooth and not too sticky, about 1 minute. The dough will be very 
	soft and moist but not so sticky that you can't roll it out. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest in a 
	warm place for 30 minutes. </li>
 <br />
	<li>Next, gently press down on the dough to remove any gas bubbles then chill, covered, 
	for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours. </li>
 <br />
	<li>When ready to roll out the dough, line a baking sheet with a lightly floured non-terry towel. Lightly flour
	 a work surface and roll out the dough to a 1/2-inch thickness. Using doughnut or cookie cutters, cut out 
	 3-inch-diameter rounds with 1-inch-diameter holes. Arrange the doughnuts on the prepared baking sheet, 
	 leaving at least 1 inch between doughnuts. Cover the doughnuts 
	 loosely with plastic wrap and let them site in a warm place until almost doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes. 
	 Check to see if the doughnuts are ready every 5 to 10 minutes. To test, use a fingertip to lightly touch one
	  of the doughnuts. If the dough springs back immediately, it needs more time. </li>
	  <br />

	<li>While the doughnuts are proofing, line a baking sheet with 2 layers of paper towels and place a wire 
	rack on top of the towels. In a heavy-bottomed large pot or deep fryer, heat at least 2 inches of oil until 
	a deep-fry thermometer registers 360°F. Working in batches, use a slotted metal spoon or spatula to carefully 
	place the doughnuts in the hot oil. Fry, flipping once, until light golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. 
	Transfer as done to the wire rack and return the oil to 360°F between batches. </li>
