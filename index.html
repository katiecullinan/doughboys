	<div class="intro">
	<p>A doughnut or donut is a type of fried dough confectionery or dessert food. The 	doughnut is popular in many countries and prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty outlets. They are usually deep-fried from a flour dough, and typically either ring-shaped or without a hole and often filled.  </p>

	<h2 class="head">ORIGINS</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="origins_text class">In ancient Rome and Greece, cooks would fry strips of pastry dough and coat them with honey or fish sauce. In Medieval times, Arab cooks started frying up small portions of unsweetened yeast dough, drenching the plain fried blobs in sugary syrup to sweeten them. The fritters spread into northern Europe in the 1400′s and became popular throughout England, Germany and the Netherlands. In 15th century Germany, where sugar was hard to come by, they were often cooked savory with fillings like meat or mushroom.   </p>

	<h2 class="head2 clear">THE NEW WORLD</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="origins_text2 class" >The doughnut came to America with the Dutch who settled in Manhattan (then New Amsterdam). They called them <i>olykoeks</i> or oily cakes.  These early doughnuts were simply balls of cake fried in pork fat until golden brown. Because the center of the cake did not cook as fast as the outside, the cakes were sometimes stuffed with fruit, nuts, or other fillings that did not require cooking. </p>

<h2 class="head">THE HOLE</h2>
<hr>
	<p class="origins_text class">The hole invention is generally attributed to Captain Hanson Gregory, a Dutch sailor whose mother made him some doughnuts for a voyage. There are many variations on this story but one is that on June 22, 1847, Captain Gregory’s ship hit a sudden storm. He impaled the doughnut on one of the spokes on the steering wheel to keep his hands free. The spoke drove a hole through the raw center of the doughnut and he said he liked the doughnuts better that way, minus the raw center  </p>
	
	<h2 class="head2 clear">WWI</h2>
	<hr>
	<p class="origins_text3 class"> Doughnuts became popular in the US after American soliders returned home from WWI. During the war female Salvation Army workers known as “Doughnut Girls” would fry and distribute doughnuts to the American soldiers fighting in France. They offered a taste of home to the soldiers, who became known as “Doughboys.” Doughnut Girls were replaced by “Doughnut Dollies” during World War II. </p>
